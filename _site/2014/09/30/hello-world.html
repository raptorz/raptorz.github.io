<p>This is my first English blog. Sorry for my Chinglish.</p>

<p>I will talk some technology about my programming work. perhaps others. I am too lazy to create a better blog, like use Jekyll or others. The README.md is good enough for me.</p>

<p>That is all.</p>

<h3 id="updated-2014-10-17">Updated: 2014-10-17</h3>

<p>I am sorry that the README.md seems not good enough. So I use Jekyll now, but ruby is not good, I donâ€™t like it.</p>
